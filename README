DESCRIPTION

Phud is an abbreviation of php mud.
It is a telnet socket server for playing text dungeon games, with races, abilities, items, and mobiles.



REQUIREMENTS

Requirements include php 5.4 and up, and redis.



CONFIGURING PHUD

To set up, open up 'game.php' in the project root and change the $address to your local network ip, ie 192.168.0.x, and your port to an open, unused port, such as 9000.
